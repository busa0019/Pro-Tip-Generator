💡 How the Mantra System Works
Template Processing
The application uses intelligent input processing:

Lessons: Transforms common phrases like "Google is my friend" into professional concepts

Fears: Converts specific worries like "debugging" into broader challenges

Grammar: Ensures natural sentence flow with proper articles and phrasing

Example Transformations
"google is my friend" → "resourcefulness in finding solutions"

"debugging" → "complex debugging challenges"

"not good enough" → "moments of self-doubt"

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Backend not starting

Check Node.js is installed: node --version

Verify dependencies: cd mantra-backend && npm install

CORS errors in browser

Ensure backend is running on port 3001

Check frontend is making requests to http://localhost:3001

Hugging Face API errors

This is normal! The system automatically uses the template fallback

Template system is reliable and always works

Form not submitting

Ensure both "lesson" and "fear" fields are filled

Check browser console for error messages

Error Messages Explained
Hugging Face API error: 404/410 - Free model unavailable, using template system (expected behavior)

API error: 429 - Rate limiting, using template system (expected behavior)

Lesson and fear are required - User didn't fill all required fields

🚀 Deployment
Local Development
Backend: cd mantra-backend && npm start

Frontend: Open index.html or use local server

Production Deployment
Frontend: Deploy static files to any web host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

Backend: Deploy to Heroku, Railway, or any Node.js hosting service

Update API_URL in script.js to point to your deployed backend
